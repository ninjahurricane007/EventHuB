# EventHuB
EventHuB is an Event Portal that is used to create and register for various events held at college. This portal is created using Python and a high-level Python Web framework called Django that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The main home page lets us log in or sign up to the portal and it also has an about us page that helps the users to know and contact the developers behind this project. After the sign in or sign up, it will redirect the users to the home page which shows the upcoming events. If the user wants to participate in an event he/she can click on the register button and fill in their details on the registration page. But if a user wants to create or delete an event he/she must know the admin password. If they provide the password after clicking the create or delete event button they will be redirected to the respective pages. In that manner, every student in the college can use the event portal to create, register and delete the events. Hope you will enjoy this project ;)
